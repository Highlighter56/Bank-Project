Legistics
     ArrayList to hold the Accounts - can be sorted through admins
     Printing out all the options{
        This could be optimized for me through a list loop maybe, but I think it will be 
        easier to just print it out}
     Waiting for valid input {
        Instead of making it so you have a bunch of loops, take in an array with each possible 
        option at each spot. Then have this seperate method handle looping until an answer is 
        givin. Once it is, return it and allow the code to progress}
     Save All acounts + details to a txt file, this would allow you to, essential, save progress 
     0 = go back / leave
     Tracking Location / Knowing what to print
        To keep track of what options should be displaied to the user, I plan to have a set of enums
